# HTML Notes

There are notes made while studying the HTML Tutorial at [W3C Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/).

---

These notes contain HTML examples.
These are not easy to write in HTML as significant characters must be replaced by HTML entities.
This, in turn, makes the source more difficult to read.

So, for the sake of my own sanity, these have been written using MarkDown syntax and then converted to HTML.

The original MarkDown and the converted HTML files are committed under the subdirectories `md` and `html` respectively.
