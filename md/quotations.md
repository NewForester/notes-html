## HTML Quotations

<hr /><!-- Quotation element -->

The `<q>` element delimits a short quotation.

```html
    <p>The crowd called <q>Long live the King !</q></p>
```

<p>will appear as:</p>
<div class=indent>
    <p>The crowd called <q>Long live the King !</q></p>
</div>

Browsers usually insert quotation marks around quotation element contents.


<hr /><!-- Block Quotation Elements -->

The `<blockquote>` element delimits a long quotation from another source.

```html
    <blockquote cite=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_%28programming_language%29>
        APL (named after the book A Programming Language) is a programming language developed
        in the 1960s by Kenneth E. Iverson.
    </blockquote>
```

<div class=noindent>
