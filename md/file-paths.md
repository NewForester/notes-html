## HTML File Paths

An absolute file path is the full URL to an Internet file.

A relative file path references a file relative to the current page and is thus within the current web site.

Relative paths should be preferred.
They will lead to fewer problems should your web site change its web address and facilitates local testing.

There are four types of file path:

  1. current directory    - `src="animage.png"`
  1. subdirectory         - `src="images/animage.png"`
  1. relative path        - `src="../images/animage.png"`
  1. site path            - `src="/images/animage.png"`
